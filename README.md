> # Welcome to Heliosphere-Style!
> To create our style, we're going to use:
> # [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs)
> Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript)
> and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you
> to write actual CSS code to style your components.
> It also removes the mapping between components and
> styles â€“ using components as a low-level styling
> construct could not be easier!
